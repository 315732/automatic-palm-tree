In February, I listened to the _Hamlet_ book. It was beautifully written by Shakespeare, and with my English, I perfectly understood all the words and meaning in the book. I could not connect with Hamlet — he was a young man who doesn’t take action. He fully showed me inaction personality, but I didn’t feel anything for the main character.

Hamlet himself, after finding the truth, did not take any action to change the situation but felt his uselessness in the plot. He had purpose and motivation, but he didn’t act; he became more toxic to the people who cared about him. I was amazed at how he goes insane, but his friends did care and tried to help Hamlet, yet both sides were helpless. Despite so many opportunities given to Hamlet, he did not take action for revenge. It’s like a book that tells us not to seek revenge or no hate.  
I really could not understand why he was so inactive. He did not capture my interest as a character, but the book is written so well that I couldn’t believe how beautifully it was crafted by William Shakespeare.

The story kept me interested in what Hamlet would do or decide about his revenge. Each character was interesting and wonderful. Everyone was trying to help Hamlet, but he didn’t care about those around him. After completing the audiobook in English, I was happy. I don’t want to spoil the story, but it’s really good, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their English. It’s worth the time to read or listen.
